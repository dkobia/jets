**Q: How do I set cookies from Jets?**

You can set cookies with the `cookies` helper in the controller. The cookies helper acts like a hash.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    cookies[:favorite] = "chocolate"
    render json: {message: "yummy cookies set"}
  end
```

**Q: How do I set headers from Jets?**

You can set headers with the `set_header` method in the controller.  Here is an example

```ruby
  def index
    set_header("MyHeader", "foobar")
    response.set_header("Custom", "MyHeader") # also works to set headers
    response.headers["Custom2"] = "MyHeader" # also works to set headers
  end
```

**Q: How do I skip the prompt for the question "Is it okay to send your gem data to Lambdagems? (Y/n)?" in a script or CI Pipeline?**

You use the env `JETS_AGREE` env variable. Examples:

    export JETS_AGREE=yes
    jets deploy

or

    JETS_AGREE=yes jets deploy
    JETS_AGREE=no jets deploy

**Q: Does Jets support windows?**

No. There are currently no plans to support windows.  Recommend trying out [Cloud9 IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) There are some nice advantages like [Faster Development](https://rubyonjets.com/docs/faster-development/) Note, you will have to pay for the ec2 instance when it’s running and for the EBS volume. For typical dev usage, found it’s about $10/mo The cost may vary. By default, the ec2 hibernates within 30m when idled to save costs.
