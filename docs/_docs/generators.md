The Jets generators piggybacks off of the Rails generators. The generators have a lot of power and can save you time. You can use `jets generate -h` to list the generators:

    $ jets generate -h
    Jets:

        application_record
        controller
        helper
        job
        migration
        model
        resource
        scaffold
        scaffold_controller
        task

    ActiveRecord:

        active_record:application_record

To get more info on each generator provide the -h flag to each of htem. Examples:

    jets generate controller -h
    jets generate job -h
    jets generate scaffold -h

Note: The help output is really the original rails generator help.
